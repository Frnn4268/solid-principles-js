# SOLID Principles in TypeScript
SOLID principles, envisioned by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), are five guidelines for crafting robust and agile object-oriented code. While primarily targeted at object-oriented languages, these principles also translate beautifully to JavaScript's flexible nature.

### Principles
#### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**Principle:** Every class or module should have a single, well-defined responsibility.

**Benefits:** Improves code focus, simplifies debugging, and enhances understanding.

Implementation:

- Break down large classes into smaller, focused ones.
- Extract functions for specialized tasks.
- Organize modules by functionality.



#### 2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
**Principle:** Software entities (classes, modules) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Benefits:** Facilitates future enhancements without rewriting existing code.

Implementation:

- Utilize inheritance and polymorphism effectively.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Employ interfaces to define contracts for behavior.



#### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**Principle:** Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering the program's correctness.

**Benefits:** Ensures consistency and predictability when replacing objects.

Implementation:

- Design subclasses to uphold the behavior and preconditions of their base types.
- Avoid introducing new errors or side effects in subclasses.
- Prioritize contracts (interfaces) over concrete implementations.



#### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**Principle:** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.

**Benefits:** Reduces coupling and improves modularity.

Implementation:

- Break down large interfaces into smaller, specific ones.
- Define separate interfaces for distinct functionalities.
- Use abstract classes or mixins for shared functionality.



#### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**Principle:** Depend on abstractions, not concretions. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

**Benefits:** Promotes loose coupling and enables flexible dependency injection.

Implementation:

- Favor abstract classes and interfaces over concrete implementations.
- Inject dependencies through constructor injection, property injection, or method injection.
- Use dependency injection frameworks to manage dependencies easily.
